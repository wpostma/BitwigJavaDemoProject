This is a dummy empty bitwig controller API project just used to save me time.

1. create new project from bitwig's help/documentation tab button.

2. make sure JDK17 (bitwig 4.2) version (or whatever current JDK is current in your bitwig version) is installed.

3. make sure the SDK is set in the IDEA ide project.
 (right click in project, Open Module Settings, check Project Settings > Modules > this module > Dependencies > Module SDK.
